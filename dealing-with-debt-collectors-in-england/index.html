Only official Bailiffs have any authority, and only when acting on a CCJ. And even Bailiffs have limitations on what they can do.</p><p class="msg msg--success">Remember that <strong>a debt collector has no legal authority</strong> to force you to do anything. even if they are contacting you about a CCJ.<br>But for most of the time, the debt doesn't even have any vaidation yet, let alone any court order.<br>Which is why you need to engage with them to to verify everything and hold them accountable for their own conduct if need be (they are well known for breaching rules and claiming false information).</p><p class="msg msg--warning">Bailiffs can only get involved if a Country Court Judgement (CCJ) is issued, which as not yet been settled. <strong>Beware</strong> that it's common for:<br>* Bailiff firms to do regular debt collection when there is no CCJ, but because they have the word "Bailiff" in the company name, you assume they are acting as a bailiff.<br>* For debt collectors to claim they are bailiffs, but only when they think their words won't be recorded (such as on your doorstep or on the phone) so is unlikely to be in writing.</p><p>Debt collectors will either be:</p><ol><li><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Genuinely representing a client.</span></li><li>Claiming to be representing their client but actually it's one of their sister / brother / parent companies that has purchased it and they are pretending it's a completely unrelated client.</li><li>Claiming to represent a client, but it's them who have purchased it.</li></ol><p>No matter which situation, it's unlikely they will say that you owe THEM the money. They will usually say things like:</p><blockquote><p>"In relation to the debt from Barclays"<br>"There is an outstanding amount for "HSBC"</p></blockquote><p>Even though their words are vague, they will still usually ask you to pay them directly making you assume they are collecting on behalf of someone else.</p><p>There is good reason for this, yes if they are genuinely collecting for a client they can't claim you owe them, but surely if they purchased the debt they can say you owe them?</p><p>Well the problems they often have are:</p><ol><li>The debts are Bulk Purchased, which invalidates certain parts of the debt assignment process. Assignment is the process of transferring ownership, so if it hasn't been transferred correctly then their 'purchase' of the debt is invalid.</li><li>Even if they have the correct paperwork for the assignment, and it's been assigned without being in bulk, it's rare to find that it's been administered correctly inline with the law.</li><li>The original creditors often do not issue the Notice of Assignment, either at all or as they should.</li><li>The original creditor will often get an insurance payout for the debt, which means it has been paid so the assignment is invalid anyway, because you can't have a debt that has been paid and also claim it's outstanding at the same time.</li></ol><p>Surely financial institutions like banks wouldn't be doing this or we'd all know about it? Well not only do they....... but it's standard practise.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight"><strong>It's important to write back,</strong> because you're setting the stage to show you're not trying to avoid.

The SRA Code of Conduct for Solicitors, RELs, and RFLs, particularly Principle 1 (uphold the rule of law and the proper administration of justice) and Principle 5 (act with integrity), underscores the importance of verifying the legitimacy of a client's claim before proceeding with such actions.</p><p> </p><p>Given the circumstances, I must remind you that involvement in actions that lack a legal foundation</p><p>may not only undermine public confidence in the legal profession but could also implicate you and Flint Bishop LLP in matters of legal misconduct.
