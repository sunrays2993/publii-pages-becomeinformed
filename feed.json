So far they have over 700 residents objecting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newsydneyplace.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bath and Northeast Somerset Council have already decided that New Sydney Place will become one of the first of 15 <strong>\"Liveable Neighbourhoods\" (LNs)</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beta.bathnes.gov.uk/what-liveable-neighbourhood-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to the council website a \"<strong>Liveable Neighbourhood\" (LN)</strong> programme is to improve residential streets and encourage safe, active and more sustainable forms of travel, such as walking, wheeling and cycling.</a></p>\n<p>As well as LTNs they are also developing separate and wider schemes list of schemes </p>\n<ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\">\n<li><a href=\"https://beta.bathnes.gov.uk/through-traffic-restriction-trials\">Experimental ETRO trials</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://beta.bathnes.gov.uk/LNRPZ\">Resident Parking Zones</a></li>\n</ul>",
