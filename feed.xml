                <p>Residents in Bath want to stop the Bath and Northeast Somerset Council from implementing for a proposed "Low Traffic Neighbourhood" (LTN), around New Sydney Place.</p>
<p>Of course these things cost money, not just for any legal cases that may need to take place but also for the time that needs to be put in and any other resources, so Neil McCabe has started a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/new-sydney-place-legal-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe campaign</a> to generate funds.</p>
<p>In the GoFundMe campaign, Neil makes the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The council appear determined to convert the <strong>"Experimental Traffic Regulation Order" (ETRO)</strong> that has been running since April into a permanent arrangement.</li>
<li>Listening to their residents is not on their radar.</li>
<li>The scheme is likely to reduce safety and increase congestion by pushing traffic onto less safe boundary roads.</li>
<li>The council have published <strong>"Statement of Reasons"</strong> setting out the aims of the <strong>ETRO</strong> but it's believed it's not legally adequate.</li>
<li>Because of this we believe there is no legal basis in law to convert it to a permanent <strong>"Traffic Regulation Order" (TRO)</strong>.</li>
<li>The type of <strong>"Statement of Reasons"</strong> used for New Sydney Place has already been proven inadequate in the legal objection to the Lower Lansdown LTN.</li>
<li>Neil is a Bath and North East Somerset resident and is currently leading a group who have objected to the New Sydney scheme. So far they have over 700 residents objecting.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsydneyplace.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bath and Northeast Somerset Council have already decided that New Sydney Place will become one of the first of 15 <strong>"Liveable Neighbourhoods" (LNs)</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://beta.bathnes.gov.uk/what-liveable-neighbourhood-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the council website a "<strong>Liveable Neighbourhood" (LN)</strong> programme is to improve residential streets and encourage safe, active and more sustainable forms of travel, such as walking, wheeling and cycling.</a></p>
<p>As well as LTNs they are also developing separate and wider schemes list of schemes </p>
